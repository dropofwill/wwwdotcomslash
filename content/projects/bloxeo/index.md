Bloxeo is a web-based collaborative brainstorming application that creates an experience making your creative process not only easier and more fun, but more productive.  Assemble a team and work off of each otherâ€™s ideas. Generate ideas into a growing bank of idea blocks. Build on the best ideas to reach that eureka moment.

To achieve this on the backend we built a system that solved many classic collaborative 'multi-player' problems. State synchronization, distributed timers, conflict resolution, handling poor network connections, etc.
