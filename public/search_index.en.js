as it turns out there were 3 main libraries written to interact with the TaskWarrior database (I think there is also a Perl and maybe a PHP wrapper as well, but I couldn't find them again and let's face it: I'm not interested in using either of those languages anyways).\nPython: taskw, GPL v3\nA project developed by Rochester's own Ralph Bean with help from 12 other devs, it is by far the most actively developed wrapper available and had a new commit just 3 days ago. It is developed by a dev who talks at rocpy every month and is the #rit-foss channel all the time, so that's a big plus. The current build status has an error, but it looks like maybe some sort of network connection problem? Will have to look into that further.\nUnfortunately, it is licensed under the v3 GPL license, which is going to make things annoying because the taskwarrior community primarily uses permissive licenses (the MIT in particular) and I prefer permissive licenses in general. However, using a copyleft non-LGPL licensed library with a compatible OSI license is legally ambiguous, which puts me in an awkward situation. Probably going to talk to Remy about this in our next Business and Legal class and report back here with some thoughts on the situation.\nOn my first run through it did not appear to have filter passing ability, which is problematic for my planned API.\nFile structure:\n\nPython: tasklib, BSD 3 Clause\nA project developed by two authors: robgolding63 and tbabej, it's under fairly active development with the latest commit being two days ago. It tries to mirror the API of a Django ORM and seems to have complete read and write functionality, including a filtering class that taskw appears to be missing.\nFile Structure:\n\nRuby: taskwarrior, MIT\nAnd last, but not least the only Ruby library available. Unfortunately, it currently only supports read operations, which means it would require heavy modifications on my end to be usable for the task_time project. It also hasn't seen active development since 2013. That said it is written Ruby and MIT licensed, so it is basically what I'm looking for.\nOn closer look though, this project works with the JSON export, so it doesn't actually interact with the TaskWarrior database at all, which is almost entirely the point of using a wrapper at all. It's looking more like if I want to do this in Ruby I'm going to be doing it on my own.\nFile Structure:\n\nFinal Thoughts\nAs much as I hate to admit it, I might have to pivot to using Python for this project, because the library wrapper is basically unusable. My options are to remake tasklib or taskw in Ruby (or at least get them to working condition). Licensing problems and the lack of a filter feature are problematic for taskw, which means my current top option is tasklib. My current plan of attack is to finalize my public API and goals for the project in parallel and finish research on dependencies by the end of next week.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/a-comparison-of-task-warrior-wrappers/","title":"A Comparison of Task Warrior Wrappers"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/a-scanner-orderly-the-smart-coaster/":{"body":"What if you could order drink with your coaster? This blog post explains how we made one using an Arduino and Node.js.\n\nArduino Source Code (BSD 3, with GPL libraries)\nNode Source Code (BSD 3)\nTeam\n\n\n\nJoe Coppola: Mechanical Engineer\n\n\nPeter Gyory: Electrical Engineer\n\n\nWill Paul: Software Engineer\n\n\nAdvisor:\n\nJames Wagoner: Actual Engineer\n\n\nDesign Overview\nA general problem with work is that we are often asked to put our mental energy towards multiple tasks at once. Often times people will say that they are good at multi-tasking, but research has shown that multitasking leads to severe bottlenecking in planning actions and information retrieval from memory.\nEnter the bar domain, a common problem, especially for busy bars, is that the bartenders are asked to manage the ordering, making, and paying for the drinks all while managing a mental queue of what to work on next. This leads to long waits and a struggle to get the bartenders attention. Our idea is to automate the ordering and queuing process, with an eye towards the payment process, to let the bartenders focus on what they do best: make drinks.\nTo achieve this we envisioned a smart coaster, which each patron would receive upon entry and would serve as their primary method of ordering drinks. Underneath the top of the coaster was a Force Resistant Sensor (FSR), which would allow the user to perform selection and detect when a drink arrived.Along the inner edge of the coaster a strand of LEDs were placed to give the user feedback on the state of their interaction with the coaster and the state of their drink. The coaster itself was 3D printed with translucent plastic so that the lights can shine through.\nOn the bottom of the coaster we needed some sort of menu reader. We looked into barcode scanners, cameras, RFID tags, but all were either too expensive or too bulky for our needs, so we ended up going for an RGB sensor to be paired with a color-coded menu. For this prototype we decided to limit the options to ordering Highballs, which are two-part mixed drinks composed of one spirit and one mixer. One benefit of the RGB sensor we chose was that it had its own light source, so it can work even in a dark bar. While the sensor was actually surprisingly accurate we decide to limit the menu to just 3 spirits and 3 mixers for simplicity.\nPics\nTop of the coaster:\n\nBottom of the coaster:\n\n\nVideos\n Shows selecting the spirit from Will Paul on Vimeo.\n Shows selecting the mixer and waiting transition from Will Paul on Vimeo.\nSupplies\n\n\nSmall Arduino, we used a Flora\n\n\n3 * 3D prints for the coaster\n\n\nAdafruit RGB Sensor\n\n\n16 Adafruit Neopixels in a strip\n\n\nStuff to make a Force Resistance Sensor, we used:\n\n\n2 Sheets of aluminum foil\n\n\n2 Sheets of laminate\n\n\n1 sheet of Velostat/Polymer\n\n\n\n\nSolder\n\n\nGlue / Electrical Tape\n\n\nResistors / Wires\n\n\nConstruction\nInside of the coaster:\n\nThe coaster itself consists of three 3D printed parts, the bottom (which has the sides, a ledge for the other two parts just large enough for the strand of LEDS, and a custom fit whole/dip for our RGB sensor), the middle part (which was just a small sheet of plastic for the FSR to set on) and the top (which was cut to fit right on the ledge and a special cutout so that the wire from connecting to the FSR didn't cause it to bulge). In the end we also added little bits of cardboard for extra support against the FSR (so that it would be more responsive), and this should probably be added to the print for future additions. Also the FSR ended up being thicker than we thought, so in future prints we would make that divot a little deeper so that it fits together a bit tighter.\nAll the internal connections were soldered and since there wasn't really room for a breadboard all the circuits were made with just wires and resistors. To keep everything insulated we made extensive use of electrical tape and hot glue (for stuff that electrical tape wouldn't stick to).\nCode\nWe had communication in both directions between the Arduino (potentially multiple) and the Express Node Server using the Serial port and communicated between the server and the (potentially multiple) clients using web sockets so that the page didn't have to be refreshed to display updates.\n\nWe used the Node serialport library to handle communication between the server and Arduino. It worked by polling the clients serial ports for any device that was sending the message 'Connect', which was what our coaster sends out until it gets the \"$\" sign response from the server (we chose \"$\" because it was single byte ASCII character that signifies end of string in Regex, so it seemed an appropriate way to close a message).\nSince there is always a high possibility of data getting lost/missed in Serial communication we implemented a UDP-esque approach where we just keep sending the message until the receiver tells us they have received it.\n\nConclusion\nObviously, a wired coaster isn't going to work in a real world environment, but the proof-of-concept is there. With a Wifi module, a 5 volt Arduino (instead of our 3.3v Flora), and a small battery pack along with some slight modifications to the model we think it could work pretty well.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/a-scanner-orderly-the-smart-coaster/","title":"A Scanner Orderly: The smart coaster"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/blink-project-hacking-on-an-arduino/":{"body":"For my Physical Computing &amp; Alt Interfaces class we had to use an Arduino (I have the latest Uno) to control LED(s) in a non-trivial way. I knew I wanted to make some kind of LED matrix, but didn't know how big of one I could make on my half sized breadboard and limited number of pins. What I ended up with was a 16 LED (4x4) matrix controlled by just 8 pins, each of which can be individually controlled.\n\n&lt;%= image_tag image_path(\"matrix_scheme.png\"), alt: \"rough schematic of the led matrix setup\", style: \"width: 30%; float: right\" %&gt;\nSo how does that work? Basically you wire it up so each row and column are interconnected and each has it's own, you can get a rough idea how it works in my simplified schematic to the right. To light up an LED all you need to do is set the row or column that its anode is connected to HIGH to give it current and then set the row or column that its cathode is connected to LOW grounding the circuit. This way even though 4 LED's are getting current and 4 LED's are grounded, only 1 is completing the circuit and lighting up. The code would look something like this:\n\nWhat if we want to light up multiple LED's at once? Well, that depends, if they're on the same row or column than there's no problem we can light them up as before. But what if they're are diagonally adjacent (as in (0,0) and (1,1)), by turning on the pins to those 4 pins we are completing the circuit for 4 LEDs instead of just the two we wanted!\n&lt;%= image_tag image_path(\"matrix_overview.jpg\"), alt: \"rough schematic of the led matrix setup\", style: \"width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em;\" %&gt;\nOne way to deal with this is to light just one LED at a time, but swap back and forth between them faster than the human eye can detect. This works quite well actually, it ends up becoming a balancing act between giving enough time for the current to light up the LED and not waiting long enough for humans to be able to detect the flicker. In my own experience the best value varies with the LED and resistors that you happen to be using, so you will probably have to experiment. In the end I went with 2 milliseconds for the best balance.\nSo how did I manage to stuff all of this wiring onto a half-sized breadboard? The trick is to use the built in wiring that the breadboard gives you. Put all of the your anodes or cathodes on the same row (whichever ones you decide to line up with the breadboards internal wiring), and then place the opposite lead one or two slots over (alternate, remember these should not share a row, but rather a column). With this technique you only need 4 wires to setup the rows (shoot the gap in the middle) and it only takes up 3 breadboard rows each, which leaves you just enough room to wire in the columns, which are a little bit more tricky, but doable because you were so space efficient with the rows. That was probably a fairly confusing, hopefully the following pictures should clear it up.\n&lt;%= image_tag image_path(\"matrix_breadboard.jpg\"), alt: \"rough schematic of the led matrix setup\", style: \"width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em;\" %&gt;\n&lt;%= image_tag image_path(\"matrix_closeup.jpg\"), alt: \"rough schematic of the led matrix setup\", style: \"width: 100%; margin-bottom: 1em;\" %&gt;\nSo cool we've got an LED matrix what to do with it? The first thing I did was make a little bar graph to test how well I could control the individual LEDs. This evolved into something like a music visualizer, only it's not visualizing a music signal, just the Arduino's random number generator.\nThat was cool, but I also wanted to make something a little more interactive, so I hooked up a potentiometer to a separate 5V power source and an analog pin. From there I use the signal from the potentiometer to steer one light as it moves about the screen. In the script your able to set the speed, degrees of control, and whether it wraps or bounces off the walls. It's kind of fun to play with, but would greatly benefit from another one or two rows of LEDs to wander about on, but as is it is a pretty cool proof of concept.\nAll the code used in this project is available as a gist on my github.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/blink-project-hacking-on-an-arduino/","title":"Blink project: Hacking on an Arduino"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/bugfix-footable/":{"body":"Everyone in the frontend community likes to hate on tables, it's like Comic Sans in the design community. And this is for mostly good reasons, tables for layouts are pretty much unnecessary in this day in age (unless you're looking to center something vertically, then maybe you can use it in your CSS, not the markup{:target=\"_blank\"}), but there are still actually legitimate uses of tables. You know like for tabular data.\n\nUnfortunately the default HTML tables aren't really that great from a UX perspective. From a functional standpoint there's no way to sort or filter data and from a design perspective it definitely still looks like something from the 90s. Now try loading that 90s era table of data with more than four columns of data on your phone, things start to get bad fast.\nThat's where FooTables{:target=\"_blank\"} comes in. It's a JQuery{:target=\"_blank\"} plugin that makes your data tables responsive with custom breakpoints, gives you some default styles that don't suck if you want them, and offers tons of new functionality, like filtering, sorting, pagination, and more. I've used on numerous occasions with great success, so when I got a job that needed to display a lot of tabular data to users (a lot of which who were mobile users), I decided to use FooTables.\nA Tale of Two Bugs\nBut when I went to include it on my page nothing happened, I just had the same old ugly table. Pop open the console and there were a bunch of ReferenceErrors coming from the FooTables source. After digging around in the source code a bit I noticed a number of instances where variables were being defined without the var keyword, like so:\n\nIn most cases this is no big deal, newVar will still be given the value foo. However, it will be added to the global scope instead of inside the scope it was defined in. So the above is the equivalent to:\n\nThat's usually not what you intend and if it is, you should probably be doing it explicitly so that other readers can understand what your doing:\n\nBut anyways, back to FooTables, it worked before, right? Why was it failing now? Well, this part was my fault. You see with ECMAScript{:target=\"_blank\"} 5 came a Perl like convention of \"strict\"{:target=\"_blank\"} mode, this does a lot of things{:target=\"_blank\"}, but the gist of it is things that worked before or failed silently would no longer be allowed in the interest of a more stable software platform. One of the items that changed was that global variables could only be assigned like the third example, and when you use that first method, yep, you guessed it, JavaScript throws a ReferenceError.\nAt first this may seem like a terrible mistake, now perfectly good programs will fail. That might not sound like much of a stability boost to you. But the folks working on the spec thought of that as well. It turns out that setting strict mode works just like variables, it only applies to the scope it's defined in. So:\n\nSo best JavaScript practice is to define strict mode only in scopes that you are responsible for, otherwise you might break third party libraries. And that's exactly the route I took on the aforementioned project (which you can see the relevant table bits for here{:target=\"_blank\"}).\nA Wild Bugfix Appears\nBut why not fix the other problem too? There's no reason FooTables shouldn't be strict mode compliant and it seemed like a pretty easy fix. So I forked the repo and dove in.\nLooking around a bit I found that it was managed with npm{:target=\"_blank\"}, distributed with Bower{:target=\"_blank\"}, and used Grunt{:target=\"_blank\"} to run the build and testing step. The files I need to edit were going to be located in the js/ directory, but first before I started messing around with the project internals I figured I better install the project's dependencies.\n\nAh, the classic npm err. I've spent countless hours debugging npm dependency errors in the past and a lot of times the solution is just to reinstall npm. So without even bothering to read the error messages I blindly upgraded npm:\n\nBut to no avail. I decided to check the error log a little closer:\n\nAhah! npm requires semantic versioning{:target=\"_blank\"}, which means version numbers must follows the pattern: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-pre-release-label. After taking a look at the git history of the package.json file where npm defines the version, it seemed like an appropriate semantic version would be 2.0.2 instead of 2.0.1.5. I edited the package.json and bower.json to reflect this and submitted a pull request{:target=\"_blank\"}.\nSince Travis.ci{:target=\"_blank\"} was setup on the project I went to watch my pull request be tested. Once it passed I went back to the pull requests page to review my submission. But it was no where to be found. Confused I hopped around from issues to pull requests wondering what happened. Finally I clicked on the \"Closed\" link on the pull requests page only to find he had already merged my pull request. A mere two minutes after I made it, at 1am on a Wednesday. Talk about a responsive upstream!\nWith that bug squashed I returned to my original mission. Finding all the violations of strict mode was as simple as running JSHint{:target=\"_blank\"} in my editor (Vim, Syntastic plugin{:target=\"_blank\"}) and exploring the context of each warning to make sure what I was doing wasn't actually breaking anything. That done, I looked at the Gruntfile to see what sort of build tasks were setup. Turns out the default task ran everything, so I just ran grunt and all the js tests passed and the builds completed. Strangely the LESS didn't compile to the same as the prior CSS (even though I hadn't changed anything) and the CSS linter threw a couple of errors. But that's a bug fix for another day. I committed just the JavaScript files to another feature branch and submitted my second pull request of the evening.{:target=\"_blank\"}\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/bugfix-footable/","title":"Bugfix: FooTable"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/c-graph-a-new-tool-to-grok-c-source-code/":{"body":"A joint post by Brendan Whitfield &amp; Will Paul\nSource code is often the most up to date documentation available, but while code is written in a linear fashion, the execution is a network of calls that often jump across files. Known as a function call graph, this data can help programmers quickly grasp the structure of a program. How can  we use visualization to make the process of grokking source code easier?\n\n\nSource Code: https://github.com/brendanwhitfield/cgraph\nLive Example: http://cgraph.herokuapp.com/\n\nThe concept of a call graph is not new, and there are several open source tools that perform such a task. Yet, after only a short time with some of these applications, many design limitations hamper their use, or clarity in visualization. The flaws range from bad workflow to information overload, all of which C-Graph attempts to address. However, before any visualizations can be made, the data for them must be generated.\nTo construct a call graph, there are two predominant solutions. The first is to dynamically build the graph through careful monitoring of the program during execution. This will show how the program truly behaves, however it is often difficult to implement. For this reason, most software resorts to statically constructed graphs. Static graphing is a simple operation of parsing the source code, and matching functions calls to definitions. While this solution has drawbacks (namely, the inability to resolve function pointers), it is straight-forward to implement, since it leverages the abilities of existing parsers. For sake of project scope, C-Graph operates statically.\nC-Graph was originally slated to use a pre-existing graphing utility as a back-end. However, after some experimentation, each utility was rejected because it failed to deliver some piece data or functionality. In particular, the ability to parse a segment of source code without its dependant libraries was a feature that did not exist in any tool. In order to easily integrate with external code repositories (such as GitHub), a custom parser was designed to suit this need. Instead of doing a full syntax parse of the user’s code (and dependant headers), the system only searches for calls and definitions. Once located, they can be linked by name and location. The C language was chosen specifically for its ease and simplicity in linking. Unlike other languages, where functions of the same name are rampant, extern C functions must carry globally unique names, thus allowing it to be linked quickly.\nOnce the data is generated from the user’s code, a visualization can be custom built. Since the data structure is fundamentally a graph, the obvious choice for visualization was a force layout. However, with the graph alone, there is no obvious connection between the graph and the code. A typical workflow would have to entail switching back and forth between a text editor and the call graph, searching for function definitions as they appear. To remedy this problem, the graph is accompanied by a pane that displays files. The user can simply click any node in the graph, and instantly be presented with the connected code. This solution allows side-by-side code and graph viewing, which dramatically helps the user traverse the source code as well as the graph.\nOne of the frequent problems with traditional call graphs is that they are simply static images. All of the complexity is thrown at the user immediately, which makes it hard for a viewer to get a high level overview of how the program works. Rather than viewing the entirety of the code at such a microscopic level, C-Graph implements a binning system, where the user can expand and collapse whole files into their composite functions. This interactivity is key to creating an understandable visualization of a potentially messy dataset. This approach was inspired by Ben Shneiderman’s classic visualization mantra “overview first, zoom and filter, then details on demand.”\nThe design of the graph itself was kept extremely simple, in order to better accommodate the deluge of information it must display. Small circles represent individual functions, and accumulate into larger circles when grouped into files. The linkages between nodes vary in weight to display the number of times a call to the same function or file has been made, while arrows encode the direction of the call. Since sometimes the functions spread out and have similar colors we used convex hulls of the same color to keep them visually grouped together even after expansion.\nOther alternatives were considered, but most were ultimately rejected due to over complication. For instance, color and sloping link weights were considered as possible methods for encoding direction, but arrows were ultimately chosen because of the small footprint. Even at the file level, it is exceptionally easy for nodes to become obscured, so great care was taken to minimize all unnecessary graphics. As another way to combat the noise of all the function calls we implemented hover highlighting, such that when the mouse is over a node the rest of the links fade out so that the focal point is just on the calls from that particular function.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/c-graph-a-new-tool-to-grok-c-source-code/","title":"C-Graph: A new tool to grok C-source code"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/commnad-line-tools-with-ruby/":{"body":"I've written a lot of Ruby code over the years from web applications, to rack frameworks, to rake tasks, even packaged a few up as gems, but one thing I've never done is write a command line tool directly in ruby. This post just sums up my initial foray into making Ruby cli tools, as usual with Ruby it's not nearly as hard as it sounds.\nThe Basics\nTypically when you write a ruby script you execute it with the Ruby command followed by a file path, like so:\n\nBut that puts a lot of weight on the user, they need to know 1) this is a Ruby program, 2) where it was 'installed', and 3) the file extension for Ruby. The API we want is this:\n\nTo accomplish this we first need to add a 'shebang' to the top of our main entry point to the application, like this:\n\nThis line tells the shell how we want the following file interpreted. We could hard code a path to ruby, but by using the env dir we let the user's shell decide what ruby is, this way people can install ruby however they want and our program will still run. To run the program directly we also need to make it executable:\n\nAnd now the program can be run without specifying Ruby:\n\nOr we can optionally leave off the Ruby extension (.rb) and run it without any knowledge that it is Ruby under the hood:\n\nBut what about that annoying ../path/to/ nonsense, the user shouldn't have to even know, much less have to type the full path to the program to run it. To solve this we have two main options (though there are certainly a number of ways to accomplish this).\nThe first and 'easiest' approach is to simply add the executable to the users PATH either in the shell, a init script, or by typing it right in the shell:\n\nThis prepends our code to the lookup PATH ($PATH is a variable for the current PATH, the colon separates different parts of the PATH) so that we don't need to know where the code is located in order to execute it.\nThis meets our original requirements, but comes with a number of problems. Are we going to make the user manage the PATH themselves? Is this run with an install shell script? What it the users' shell of choice doesn't use the export API? What if they want to move where the install directory is on their computer? All these questions lead us to believe there must be a better or at least more standardized approach to this.\nAnd as it turns out there is! The people behind RubyGems have put a lot of thought into this, so that when you create a gem you can define a set of files that can be used as executables and it then copies them to #{ruby-prefix}/bin/{#gem_name}, which is already added to their PATH during the installation of Ruby and is managed by tools like rbenv, chruby, or RVM so that you don't have to.\nThe downside to this is that their is a bit of extra boilerplate needed to comply with the whole gemspec standard, but in the long run this is well worth the extra startup time. Luckily the bundler gem, a popular gem manager (that itself is a gem), comes with a scaffold-er to keep the amount of boilerplate you need to write to a minimum as well as giving you a set of best-practices/conventions that the rest of the Ruby community often follows. To create a new project run bundler gem #{your_gem_name_here}, which initializes a git repo and gives us the following file structure:\n\nBy default it gives you a copy of the MIT license, this is by far the most popular license within the Ruby community, but you are free to change it to whatever you like (just make sure you update those changes in your gemspec as well). You should also add your dependencies in the Gemfile (if you have any), add your code to the lib/ dir, and then create a new bin/ dir with the cli code (which hopefully require's whatever the rest of your lib does for DRY purposes). Then it's just a matter of updating the *.gemspec file to meet your requirements. The key bit that bundler gives us by default is what does the making bin/ executable business:\n\nThe first line adds only files tracked by git (a classic error is not adding changes to git before building if you leave this line in), you can of course use any other Ruby/shell code to grab the paths you want. The second line does the job of telling RubyGems what files to add to the users path, basically it looks through the list of files regex-ing for the bin and adding the files in that dir. Of course if you don't want to put your executables in bin/, you could rename that dir and regex for that something different here. Bin is just a convention of course and the *.gemspec file is just a plain old Ruby file, so anything you want to add here will work just fine.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/commnad-line-tools-with-ruby/","title":"Writing Command Line Tools with Ruby"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/creating-and-deploying-a-middleman-blog-part-1-what-s-middleman/":{"body":"This is the first in what will probably be a three part series on creating and deploying a Middleman{:target=\"_blank\"} site, specifically a blog deployed to a Heroku{:target=\"_blank\"} instance.\nWhere we're going in the next couple of posts:\n\nWhat's Middleman?\nBlogging with Middleman\n3.-Deploying\n)\n\nWhat's Middleman?\nMiddleman is a static site generator built in the programming language of Ruby{:target=\"_blank\"} and the Rack{:target=\"_blank\"} interface. As a generator it allows you to use features of \"modern web development\" that you would expect in a backend framework without the extra overhead of database. It also comes packaged with a \"server\" that runs on Rack, designed to be run in development so you can see your changes live instead of having to rebuild every time. But as we'll see in a later post you can also use this to run Middleman in production to host on a site like Heroku.\nWhy and When to Use a Static Site Generator?\nSo why even bother with a static site generator, doesn't it just add needless complexity? Another point of failure? To some extent yes. You need to weigh your options, but here's the thing: if you're building a site with more than 4 or 5 pages without some sort of templating system, the time sink won't be problems with your generator, it's going to be changing the verbiage in the footer for the tenth time or something equally stupid.\nThe way I see it you have 4 basic options:\n\nPlay it close to the metal use a programming or web server for dynamic content directly (e.g. PHP{:target=\"_blank\"} or Apache{:target=\"_blank\"}).\nGet a little help from a framework and templating language to standardize your setup (e.g. Django,{:target=\"_blank\"} Wordpress{:target=\"_blank\"}, Slim{:target=\"_blank\"}).\nUse a task runner to manage the repetitive or laborious tasks for you (e.g. Grunt{:target=\"_blank\"} or Make{:target=\"_blank\"}/Rake{:target=\"_blank\"}).\nUse a static site generator (e.g. Middleman{:target=\"_blank\"}, Jekyll{:target=\"_blank\"}, or Pelican{:target=\"_blank\"}).\n\nObviously, these are extremely loose distinctions and there certainly can be overlap between them (e.g. using Grunt with Slim or Mustache is something I've done on many occasions).\nIMO, 1 is a dangerous game unless you're working alone and know what you're doing. Even so, tying your markup to one language or even worse one web server seems like a bad idea. What if later on you realize running NGINX{:target=\"_blank\"} for your web server would lead to a noticeable speed boost. Suddenly all those Apache specific Server Side Includes{:target=\"_blank\"} are broken and you're back to editing every single template again.\n2 is a good choice if you know where a project is headed long term, though there is quite a bit of technical debt to take on when starting a project like this, depending on what choices you make. Though this subsides with experience in the framework, for instance while it seems like a poor idea I wouldn't mind prototyping the frontend of a project in Rails, because I've built so many sites with it over the past couple of years. But ask me to do that with say Wordpress or Django it would be a different story, it would just be too much of a waste of time if we weren't completely sure what the final backend would be and even then I probably would rather not.\nThat's kind of where 3 comes in, it's the middle ground, a good place to start prototyping a project when you don't know where it's actually going to end up. Most templating languages or implemented in all the modern web languages so pick one with good support and you're code base remains portable from web server to programming language.\nSo where does this leave Middleman and company? It's kind of a niche market to be honest, it's for situations where developers or at least technically savvy individuals are going to be editing content (it's all templates and markdown, no pretty CMS to hold your hand) and where your sure you won't be adding a backend at a later date. So generally what we're looking at are personal sites and project sites. One advantage here is the ease of use, while perfecting a Gruntfile can be an arduous task, with something like Middleman it can be as simple as middleman init and you're off and running.\nWhy Middleman?\nWhy Middleman specifically and not Jekyll or Hexo{:target=\"_blank\"} or one of hundreds of other generators{:target=\"_blank\"} popping up all over the web? Well, for me personally it's because Middleman models itself after Rails and that's just what I was familiar with so I gave it a shot. To be honest I've only messed around with Hugo{:target=\"_blank\"} and Hekyll{:target=\"_blank\"} (as a way to mess around with Go and Haskell respectively), so I can't definitively say that Middleman is particularly better (and if you want to publish to Github pages Jekyll probably seems like the better integrated option...).\nSo what Rails features carry over? The main tenant of Rails development is \"convention over configuration\", basically most people are trying to do similar things with their web frameworks, so why not pre-configure everything to work out of the box and sprinkle in some best practices along the way? This mantra is alive and well in the Middleman community and for the most part you probably won't make that many changes in the config.rb file.\nLike Rails, Middleman ships with Erb, Sass, and CoffeeScript support, as well as the prettier (but awfully slow{:target=\"_blank\"}) Haml and the Markdown engine Kramdown (the fastest ruby implementation, with some nice extra features){:target=\"_blank\"}. However, if you prefer logicless templates like me it's trivial to add Slim support or a different markdown engine or whatever.\nAlso like Rails you get an Asset Pipeline complete with Sprockets{:target=\"_blank\"} for file concatenation so you can keep your JavaScript under control in multiple files. One advantage of this setup is you can turn on cache busting which appends a unique number to the end of each asset url that changes whenever the asset changes so no more asking a client to clear their cache or anything like that. You can also lock into the pipeline with an image compressor that will automatically make sure none of your images make it into production any larger than they need to be.\nOther features like local data (they call it Frontmatter), dynamic pages (we'll talk more about this with the blog plugin later), localization, routes, and more are all at your finger tips. If you would like to dive in check out the Getting Started page or try out a template like my Bower/Slim setup{:target=\"_blank\"} or one from the ever growing official list{:target=\"_blank\"} or make your own it's super easy.\nUntil next time happy hacking!\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/creating-and-deploying-a-middleman-blog-part-1-what-s-middleman/","title":"Creating and Deploying a Middleman Blog, Part 1: What's Middleman?"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/creating-and-deploying-a-middleman-blog-part-2-blogging-with-middleman/":{"body":"Last time I talked about static site generators in general (why you would use them) and a little bit about Middleman specifically (why you would use it in particular).

A common use of this is to set the title of a page or in a blog context set tags and date information. For instance, on this blog I use YAML and the Frontmatter for this post looks as folows:\n\nNow you might be thinking cool, but that looks like a bit of a pain to have to type out, esp. the date. How do you remember to format that? The answer is I don't, instead I use a middleman scaffolding feature to give me the barebones of an article to start with:\n\nOf course all this can be configured in your config.rb, but chances are the defaults will get you mostly where you want to go (convention over configuration ftw!).\nWhat About Feature X?\nNo doubt you have qualms about ditching the backend completely for something even as simple as a blog. What if in the future I want to implement a tag cloud, or calendar, or whatever? First let me direct you to the middleman-blog documentation page, which shows you how to do just about everything that WordPress does out of the box (feeds, pagination, calendar, etc).\nBut what I think is really important to highlight is that you are not really abandoning the backend, the code you write for Middleman can look practically the same as you Rails code, what really is happening is we're moving the backend into a preprocessing step saving not just developer time, but CPU time as well. It's a bit of a paradigm shift for sure and certainly isn't for every or even most situations (just see my last post), but I think personal blogging is an domain where it really shines. Especially for developers who want to have control over the stack, but don't want to mess around learning the idiosyncrasies of Drupal or WordPress.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/creating-and-deploying-a-middleman-blog-part-2-blogging-with-middleman/","title":"Creating and Deploying a Middleman Blog, Part 2: Blogging with Middleman"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/creating-and-deploying-a-middleman-blog-part-3-deployment/":{"body":"Two posts ago I talked about static site generators in general and Middleman specifically. After that I talked about how to use Middleman for blogging and again talked about different use cases. Today I am going to talk about deployment options and how you can get your site onto the web.\nThe Options\nThe beautiful thing about static site generators is the portability, you can just throw it on any server that's public facing and can serve files and it just works. That said there are certain practices that can make your life easier, and deploy your sites safely with versioning and without ever having to touch an FTP client. I'm going to talk about one of many of these possible configurations, Heroku{:target=\"_blank\"} with Puma{:target=\"_blank\"}.\nHeroku with Puma (What this site is currently running on)\nPuma is a Ruby web server built specifically for Rack applications, with the intent on being fast and efficient. In some of the latest benchmarks it used 10% of memory that Unicorn did while still beating it by more than a third in terms of requests per seconds. This improvement comes at the cost of portability, as it only works on Ruby Rack applications, but when that's what you have (which we can easily turn Middleman into) it makes a great choice. Especially when your using a SAAS like Heroku, who makes their money by charging for \"Dynos\" (you can think of it as a CPU container).\nSo what are the steps?\n\nAdd rack-contrib and puma to the Gemfile\n(Optional) configure a 404 page and pretty urls\nAdd the Rack config: config.ru\nAdd the Procfile so Heroku knows what's up\nInstall Heroku command line tools\nPush to Heroku!\n\n1. Add rack-contrib and puma to the Gemfile\nHeroku will install all the gems in our Gemfile on push (at least those not in any non-production groups), a lot of these are going to be unnecessary, but that won't hurt anything. That said we are going to need some way to serve our files and the easiest way to install stuff on Heroku will be in our Gemfile.\nSo simply add Rack and Puma to the Gemfile like so:\n\nYou could be safe by specifying a version, but I don't foresee that being that big of a problem with these particular gems.\n2. (Optional) configure a 404 page and pretty urls\nThis really doesn't have anything much to do with deployment, but will make some of the settings in the next step make more sense. Basically just create a page somewhere to be the 404 (I put mine in source/404.html) and turn on pretty urls in config.rb:\n\nThis basically just turns all the urls into the form: path/to/page/ instead of: path/to/page.html.\n3. Add the Rack config: config.ru\nThis is the main guts of the post and may be a bit hard to read if you aren't familiar with Ruby or Rack applications. All try to comment what's going on clearly, but the main thing to look out for are:\n\nSymbols: :symbol are basically just more efficient strings. Often used as configuration flags, keys in hashes, and internally they are used to reference instance methods.\nMethod calls don't have to have parentheses around the parameters and a lot of ruby programmers leave them out unless they are absolutely necessary (makes code read more like English).\nKey Pairs are separated by the 'hash rocket': key =&gt; value or alternately if you're using symbols as the keys the compressed syntax: key: value\nThe double colon :: is basically a namespace resolution operator, it's how you access items in nested modules.\n\nOk, so here's the code:\n\n4. Add the Procfile so Heroku knows what's up\nHeroku still doesn't quite know what to do with all this, until we clearly define our app's processes. This is done in a Procfile like so:\n\nBasically just defines a web process that runs Puma on a port and rack setup in the environment variables (bundle exec just means execute this command in the 'context' of the bundle, which may or may not be necessary if you run it locally, depends on how you manage your Ruby installs).\n5. Install Heroku command line tools\nNow to push to Heroku you're going to need an account and the command line tools. You can find detailed instructions here{:target=\"_blank\"}. I recommend installing it with Brew if you're on OSX and checking your package manager if you're running Linux.\n6. Push to Heroku!\nNow assuming you are already setup with get, you shoud be able to make your project Heroku ready by running heroku create [Your App Name]. Then to make it live run git push heroku master.\nNow test your site by going to [Your App Name].herokuapp.com\nFor more generalized Heroku deployment guidance checkout their docs.{:target=\"_blank\"}\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/creating-and-deploying-a-middleman-blog-part-3-deployment/","title":"Creating and Deploying a Middleman Blog, Part 3: Deployment"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/geocoding-my-lastfm-data/":{"body":"One question that often comes to my mind is how does geographical location (and the culture that comes with it) influence the band’s music and therefore my taste as well. So that’s why I decided to use this data to create a cartogram of my listening data.\n\n\nLive interactive example available here\nCheck the code out here on Github https://github.com/dropofwill/d3-lastfm-geo-viz\nLast.fm is a social music service that as one of it’s branches tracks user’s listening history and makes it publicly available through an API. I personally have had Last.fm setup on my Spotify account since March 17th, 2012 with other devices added at different points between now and then (so this is actually a small subset of my total listening history). This results in a dataset of 1,017 artists and 22,285 songs played.\nUnfortunately, Last.fm doesn’t include location information directly, even though it is usually contained somewhere in the artists bio page. Luckily, Echonest provides location data (along with a lot’s of other interesting features) and it includes a foreign key identification system that uses the same identifier as Last.fm. Running this on my listening data returned results in about an 80% success rate, with most of the misses being local bands or bands with only a couple of plays. There were a few big exceptions though that may skew the results, the top 4 for instance had playcounts of over a hundred, including my most played artist (a composer that would have increased Iceland’s counts significantly).\nI then fed that data into Google’s geocoding API to get precise latitude and longitude numbers to project on to the map. This had a 100% “success rate” because the API will always do the best it can (even if that means a point in the center of the earth), in general in mainly passed the eye test, with only one definitely wrong geocoding that I uncovered (Giraffes? Giraffes! are not really from the middle of Russia, but rather a suburb of Boston).\nVisualization Approach\nI knew I wanted to use a cartogram to combine playcounts and geolocation, but one problem I didn’t consider prior to getting the data was just how sparse my listening data really is. Less than 10% of countries had a single play and about 68% of plays were concentrated in just two countries, the United States and Great Britain. Under most cartogram approaches this would lead to almost certainly unrecognizable geographies, because the scale differences would just be too great.\nSo I decided to take a hybrid approach: a cartogram aspect for the playcount encoding placed on top of a normal world map to provide context. From there I made the countries that didn’t have any artist data transparent, so that they preserved the context, but didn’t overpower the cartogram aspect of the visualization. This also had the side effect of making it clear which countries have playcount data. However, this made the cartogram blend in with the map, so I gave each hexagon a dark border so that they remained the focal point.\nThis was an improvement, but there were still issues with the force layout, hexagons strayed far away from their origins losing a lot of the original geographical meaning. I improved this by tweaking the attributes of the layout (more friction, less response to collisions, etc.), but I still wasn’t satisfied. So I decided to have two different layouts that the user could swap. The initial layout preserves the geographic data at the expense of overlap, to keep the stacks readable in dense areas I decided to make the hexagons slightly transparent and then sorted the DOM by size. This made it so every hexagon was still visible and more opaque areas visually implied the density of their artist data.\nInteractivity\nZoom In/Out: either scroll wheel/touch pad or on screen buttons.\nPan: Click and drag to move the map around.\nReset: click the on screen button to go back to the default zoom and pan.\nZoom to a country: Click a given country to zoom to the countries bounding box and bring up country details in the text box. Click on it again or the Reset button to go back.\nLock Gestures: Lock gestures if they make scrolling a pain (e.g. on a touch device).\nSpread Artists: toggle between the two cartogram views.\nHover Artist Hexagon: Brings up the data about the given artist and their country.\nData Encoding\nSpatial Distribution: Location of the bands relative to each other and the world as a whole.\nEncoding: One view has them placed as accurately as the data allowed (at the expense of overlapping data points) and the other view places them as close to their location without any overlap (using collision detection and a force layout).\nQuantitative: Play count per artist.\nEncoding: Relative size of the hexagons and text that displays the absolute number on hover.\nQuantitative: Play count per country and Echonest artist familiarity and “hotttnesss”\nEncoding: Text that displays on hover.\nCategorical: Which geographical regions the artists are from.\nEncoding: Color of the hexagons match the countries they are from.\nCategorical: Echonest genre data\nEncoding: Text that displays on hover.\nResources\nBlog Posts/Examples:\nOne of Mike Bostock’s many insightful walkthroughs, this time on map creation from raw shape files.\nThis whole blog is fairly insightful, but this post on the creation of a hexagonal cartogram was particularly useful.\nJason Davies is a major contributor to D3 and his articles on maps and projections were useful.\nThis was a good overview of cartogram techniques.\nAnd another good overview of cartogram techniques.\nA pseudo Demers cartogram example, helped me grok collision detection with quadtrees and force layouts mixed with geographic projections.\nLibraries:\nD3.js\nD3.geo.projection.js, this plugin includes the Kavrayskiy projection I used for a nice world map isn’t provided with the D3 library (to keep it light).\nTopojson, handles the GeoJson files to get them in a format D3 can use.\nQueue.js, make sure asynchronous requests are handled in a controlled, predictable manner.\nColorbrewer, for the map’s color scheme.\nFuture Work\nDynamic Data: Last.fm has a large user base, which seems to be fond of data visualizations and may be interested in this sort of map. The major hold up with that is the data gathering step, for my data set of ~1,000 artists and ~22,000 songs it took about one and a half hours to collect, which obviously wouldn’t be a successful in a dynamic environment (“Come back in two hours to see your results.”) and this would just be compounded if multiple users hit the system at once.\nOne potential fix for this would be to use a data store to keep track of the Echonest and Google Maps API calls, since the data in these responses is unlikely to change. This cut down data gathering time exponentially since Last.fm’s rate limiting is significantly smaller than Google and Echonest. It could be prepopulated with 2,500 artists per day (Google daily cap) that could be gathered off of a breadth first search of Last.fm’s artist tree.\nDifferent Cartogram Representation: forces and collision detection make a decent cartogram, but as it is a non-deterministic approach occasionally it’s resulting state or how it got there are little annoying. One example I stumbled upon fairly late in the project was this [force snap to grid approach](http://vallandingham.me/force_talk/#64 and http://fathom.info/topovsgeo), which demonstrates mapping x/y or lat/lng coordinates to different grid spaces (including hexagonal). I can envision representing each artist as a graph of connected nodes (all of equal area) outlined and roughly aligning to the their country of origin. This would still allow for charge forces to separate clusters while alleviating the jitter problem that comes with using collision detection (since all node would be the same size).\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/geocoding-my-lastfm-data/","title":"Geocoding my Last.fm Data"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/mouse-rat-rethinking-the-mouse-computer-interface/":{"body":"Design exploration for a wearable gesture based mouse glove.\n\n\nTeam\n\n\nJoe Coppola: Production Manager\n\n\nPeter Gyory: Electrical Engineer\n\n\nWill Paul: Lead Programmer\n\n\n\nThe two major ways people interact with a computer are the keyboard and mouse. The former is a precise input, used for tasks where the user knows exactly what they want to do or at least knows how to search for it if they don't. The mouse on the other hand is an inherently fuzzy and visual input, what it lacks in precision and automation it makes up for in how easy it is to pick up and explore.\nA problem with both these inputs is that they are stationary (require to be setting on something) and can lead to repitive stress injuries (something that my teammate Joe has). Our idea was to recreate the fuzzy human-computer interaction with a device thatwasn't a peripheral, but wearable. By using an accelerometer instead of an optical input we free the user from a desk and by using a glove we allow the user to interact in the most non-invasive way possible: however they want (at least in theory).\nSince this is a wearable and multipurpose devices the taxonimies of experience don't really fit well. Total success in this respect would be if the user didn't experience anything, it should be transparent to the interaction that the user is currently experiencing. In that respect I guess focus and control are closest to what we want to create.\nOut of that comes the aspects of meaning we are trying to create: freedom and oneness. Freedom in the sense that it could be used on a couch just as easily as a desk. Oneness in the sense that we want to create a more organic way to communicate with a computer. This is one part of a system that points us towards the goal of HCI one day mirroring the way we communicate with each other (gestures, speech, and facial expressions).\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/mouse-rat-rethinking-the-mouse-computer-interface/","title":"Mouse Rat: Rethinking the mouse computer interface"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/mouse-rat-technical-explanation/":{"body":"Technical explanation for a wearable gesture based mouse glove. It used the Arduino Flora, the wearable LSM9DSO accelerometer, and MPR121 capacitive touch breakout, all from Adafruit.\n\nSource code available on Github: dropofwill/mouse_rat\n\nTeam\n\n\nJoe Coppola: Production Manager\n\n\nPeter Gyory: Electrical Engineer\n\n\nWill Paul: Lead Programmer\n\n\n\nSupplies\n\n\nAdafruit Flora (Gemma should also work)\n\n\nAdafruit Wearable LSM9DSO\n\n\nAdafruit Breakout MPR121 (no wearable version available)\n\n\nConductive/regular thread and needle\n\n\nConductive fabric (just a little bit for the fingers)\n\n\nFlexible wire\n\n\nSoldering tools &amp; supplies\n\n\n\"Schematic\"\nHere is a rough schematic of how to wire up all the sensors. The key point to note here is that we actually are just using SDA/SCL and chaining the capacitive and touch sensor together. This works fine because that's how the Flora wearables were designed, with one caveat you have to make sure the two sensors have different ids internally.\n\nWhat it looks like\n\n\n\nCode\nMy main role on the project was programming (and the occasional soldering venture when Peter got lightheaded from being bad at soldering), so I'll talk a little bit about the code. Interacting with the mouse on the screen was pretty simple because Arduino provides a library for moving, clicking, and scrolling the mouse.\nThe capacitive touch was simple to setup, except for the aforementioned I2C id issue. As the project came to a close we ended up tweaking some internal values in the library to make the touch a little less sensitive. We actually experienced a lot of crashes before we soldered the connections, even though are connections were tightly wound. Afterwards that problem completely went away (yay!).\nMost of my time then was spent converting accelerometer data into mouse movements. The first problem to consider is that people hold their hand in different positions and elevations, which change the values we get. To handle this we added a calibration loop on startup to get a range of min/max values that should be treated as stationary. We then took the mean value of this range and subtracted it from any accelerometer inputs to make sure input wasn't weighted in a particular direction. We also clamped inputs to between 20 and -20 m/s^2 to keep violent motions from going too crazy. We polled the accelerometer about 120 times a second for these values and mapped them to between -30 and 30 pixels relative to the current position of the mouse.\nWrap up\nIn the end the glove mouse wasn't as effective as we had hoped. Accelerometer input is even more fuzzy then optical and it became clear to us why you don't see that many acceleration based mice on the market. The glove we used had conductive finger tips, which contrary to what we thought, actually hinders the capacitive touch sensors (it raises the baseline current so that it takes a lot of pressure to register a touch), so we had to move the clicking mechanism to below the finger tips. The glove itself is sort of fragile (lots of components sewed on to stretch material) and an aspect of using a glove that we didn't consider was that it gets fairly warm inside after a bit of use.\nIf we did it again some changes we would make from the construction side of things would be to use a lighter weight glove (maybe even just mesh) as we only really need three fingers and a place to put the sensor components we could probably even cut the idea of using a glove down to just caps on the finger tips connected with flexible wire to deal with the heat and discomfort.\nFrom a programming stand point this could definitely benefit from a more advanced calibration process, right now our sensor has 9 degrees of freedom and we are really only calibrating using 3. Movement is still kind of awkward (reminiscent of the Lenovo ThinkPads joystick in the middle of the keyboard), we could probably improve this through using a more advanced acceleration to pixels conversion system.\nAll that aside we ended up with a somewhat usable mouse that is actually a lot of fun to mess around with. So not ready for production at all, but a fun project and we all learned a lot.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/mouse-rat-technical-explanation/","title":"Mouse Rat: Technical explanation"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/my-vim-config-part-1-the-basics/":{"body":"As someone that came to Vim from Sublime Text (through the excellent Vi-ntage mode), one thing that held me back was just how annoying the default Vim settings are. In a way looking back at it that wasn't a bad thing, it let me really craft my own configuration that I'm pretty happy with, but always looking for ways to improve. In order to help someone else a who is headed down that path find a config that works for them a little quicker.\n\nTo start off I just want to look at the basic stuff, how do we get rid of all that annoying old Vi stuff and get some useful defaults?\nFirst, the most important thing to do is turn off Vi-compatibility, unless you plan on using this config on really old computers you shouldn't have any need for this compatibility.\n\nBy default backspace in Vim's insert mode behaves a little weirdly. It works as you expect on a single line, but doesn't allow you to delete over new lines, automatically indented text, or beyond the point where you entered insert mode. You can change that by adding that to the backspace setting. I also like to set utf-8 to handle odd characters without trouble (I use √ all the time in todo lists for example).\n\nNext we want to make things start to look a little better (more on that in a later post). Most of this is pretty self explanatory. One cool thing is relativenumber/number this sets it so the current line give you the actual line number with all the other lines relative to that. This makes it so it's easy to run commands like 10j or 5dd without having to count the lines.\nScroll off makes sure the current line always has n lines above or below visible. Some people like to set this to 4000 or some other high number to always keep the cursor in the center of the screen, personally I like to just leave it at 4 or 5.\n\nTabs are something that everyone complains about with Vim and they are a little bit confusing at first. Basically the width of what your tab key creates and what the shift keys (&lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;, &lt;, and &gt;) create are two separate settings, even though you would very rarely actually want them different. Here I'm just showing how I like to indent my code in a perfect world (2 spaces, autoindented nicely), later when we talk about plugins I'll show you how to do this on a per file-type basis.\nBreakindent is a bleeding edge feature added to Vim 7.4, which makes words wrap such that they respect the indent level. This makes word wrap with long-lined and heavily indented code (cough html cough) actually alright to look at.\n\nIf you still want to be able to use the mouse and your terminal allows it, you can enable it with this function. I used to, but I find it gets more in the way than I actually use it, but it's nice to know how to enable it if you want it sometime.\n\nOne thing you'll notice when working with Vim is all these dotfiles it litters all over your working directory. These are how maintains undo state across sessions as one example. A lot of people just disable this because they don't like the clutter and use version control (which everyone should of course). But instead of just getting rid of it I like to throw it in a tmp directory somewhere so if some catastrophic does happen I have a backup plan.\nAlso copy and paste isn't great out of the box, setting copyindent makes things a lot more bearable.\n\nFinally some more personal choices that I've found useful. Colorcolumn just draws a vertical sstripe at 80 characters wide to show when my code is getting to wide. Incsearch and hlsearch make regex-ing a nicer visual experience. Set spell is awesome, it highlights your mistakes, and gives you a list of suggestions when you run za=. Run :help spell for more details.\n\nThat's it for now, next time we'll talk about the adventure that is key remapping.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/my-vim-config-part-1-the-basics/","title":"My Vim Config Part 1: The Basics"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/my-vim-config-part-2-shortcut-keys/":{"body":"This is a continuation of my short series (part 1) on how I setup Vim to be a little more fully featured looking at the custom shortcuts. By no means is my setup the best, but there are a few neat things I've stumbled upon and my thought is that by aggregating them here someone else might find something new to add. Or maybe someone knows a better way to do something and lets me know. So let's get started!\n\nFirst you'll want to start by remapping the leader key to something you're comfortable with. In case you are not familiar, the leader key is the key that you press and release before ('leads') you send a custom key command to Vim. Personally I don't have any custom commands that make sense in insert mode, so I remap it to space. By default it is /, pick your poison and let's get started.\n\nIn Vim one of the keys to moving around efficiently, besides just avoiding the arrow keys, is using regex search to your advantage. There are four different types of regex in Vim that you can set by leading your regex with an escaped flag. These represent different levels of 'magic', which sounds scary, but really just controls what symbols need to be escaped when you're writing them (check out :help magic for a detailed overview). In general I prefer the very magic mode (\\v), which let's you write a regex in a mostly Perl compatible way, which is probably what you're familiar with. To use that by default I just remap / to /\\v. That way if I actually want one of the other modes I can always just backspace two characters and we're back to magic mode.\n\nAfter searching Vim will highlight results, which are great while you're looking for them, but are distracting if your done searching. To clear this we can run :noh. Since I do this so often I remap it to double tap space.\n\nIf you ever turn on word wrapping you might have noticed that the j/k movements don't work with visual lines, but code lines. That's not usually what I want (consistency of visual units is more important to me personally), so I remap them to their display line counterparts gj/gk:\n\nI use bracket jumping a lot (e.g. moving between matching (), {}, etc.), by default this uses the %, but that's an awkward two key press, so I remap it to the tab key.\n\nBuffer movement by default is a little bit awkward at first, though it gets better with familiarity. Often you just want to jump around linearly between files, so I made shortcuts for previous and next buffer (bp and bn) that line up with &lt; &gt; keys so that makes a bit of visual sense.\n\nGetting out of insert mode early and often is a key to being productive in Vim, because of that there are a lot of ways to send the escape signal (, , and &lt;ctrl-[&gt;), but in case any of those aren't fast enough for you, you can always remap it to some obscure combo of home rule keys. I like the kj combo, but others use jj or jk as well.\n\nIf you use Vim windows (think window splits) frequently, then I think it makes sense to remap creation and movement between them to something less verbose. I use leader w for vertical splits and leader e for horizontal ones. I also in the same command move the cursor there because rarely do I create a split and then do nothing with it. Movement while intuitive, takes one to many key presses for my taste, so I get rid of the w and just move with &lt;ctrl-h,j,kl&gt;.\n\nClosing a buffer without closing a split is a lot harder than you would expect. The following command does some previous/next buffer magic to make it work. One limitation of this approach is that you need a few buffers to make it work, but since that's usually when you would want it, that's not too big of a deal.\n\nIn the last four I remap my arrow keys, which you may or may not be ready to give up yet. The first two are my left and right arrow keys to bring up the previous regex search or command mode run. These only save one key stroke, but are something I do often enough that I think its worthwhile, YMMV.\n\nThe next one is pretty cool, it moves the current line or selection up or down a single line based on the arrow key you use.\n\nAnd that's it for now.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/my-vim-config-part-2-shortcut-keys/","title":"My Vim Config Part 2: Shortcut Keys"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/packaging-ruby-gems/":{"body":"In the Ruby community the most common way to distribute software is in a packaged format cutely named gems (similar to the Python concept of Eggs). This manages dependencies and meta data much like the other packaging platforms, but with Ruby syntax in a file called '#{you_gems_name}.gemspec'. This process is completely automated through the Ruby gems, gem (installation/RubyGems.org integration), bundler (dependency management and boiler plate code), and rake (Ruby make, to streamline the process).\n\nSo the release process is as simple as updating the metadata (version number, and any changelog, or whatever) and running rake build, rake release.

In the end putting the pads on top of the speakers muffled them too much so we moved them out on their own. Also, making a sound wave that resembles a drum kit turns out to be way harder than we thought. I tried down sampling drum beats and extracting pitch contours, but even when using two speakers the best beats sounded just like radio noise.\nSince that wasn't getting anywhere we decided to pivot to something else that used multiple sounds at once. Supposedly the Arduino Uno has 3 timers, but whenever we tried to use the third one it would crash, so we were limited to two tones at a time. This left us with the dyads, the most obvious of which were power chords. We tried a few different progressions, but the one you see in the video is A5-D5-E5. The way it works is if you press just one pad it plays the root note of the chord, but when you tap a second pad it plays the fifth as well (to form the power chord).\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/playing-power-chords-on-an-arduino/","title":"Playing power chords on an Arduino"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/rtasklib-first-release/":{"body":"So the semester has come to a close and I've made the first 'official' release of rtasklib. Install the gem from RubyGems.org (gem install rtasklib) or install the RPM on your Fedora system if you prefer. I reached out to the TaskWarrior devs and they also are adding rtasklib to the list of available libraries on the TaskWarrior main website in the next few days, which is pretty cool.\n\nUnfortunately, I was unable to finish task_time for the end of the semester. That said the pieces are in place and I hope to get something out over the summer.\nAll in all it was good learning experience. I don't often tread that far away from Web Dev, despite the fact that I spend a good part of my day on the command line. It's also the first time I've went through the process of actually releasing one of the gems I've made to RubyGems, so that was a good experience. Packaging for RPMs was a lot less easy and made appreciate the Ruby system a lot more than I did previously.\nIf anyone in the future needs to package up a Ruby Gem, I stumbled upon this random post on Fedora's GitLab, which was invaluable in just understanding the process from someone that obviously has done this quite a bit (and also not a first page Google result). Also, the gem2rpm gem (from Fedora) is pretty good at extracting as much meta data as it can from the Ruby .gemspec, but you have to do quite a bit more to get a working RPM (especially if you have many Gem dependencies).\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/rtasklib-first-release/","title":"rtasklib first release"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/rtasklib-update-march-16th/":{"body":"Over the last couple of weeks the overall architecture has been in a state of flux as I have been swapping pieces in out to see what will work best. Now as I approach my original milestone for having this in a working condition things are starting to fall into place. Models for tasks and configuration are pretty much stable, initialization of the configuration is done, and validation and serialization of tasks are coming along. The main bit of work left to do is writing the controllers to hook all of the components together and will effectively make up the public interface for the library.\nA little implementation detail\nFor the configuration file I decided to effectively store it as a shallow hash structure before converting it to a Virtus domain object. The config will be immutable because there should not be a need to both permanently and dynamically change the users configurations, the latter alone can be configured on a per call basis with the rc: flag. Because of this we only have to go in one direction, which makes the serialization layer less restrictive. As I mentioned last week taskw implemented a deep nested hash like this:\n\nI went with the simplest solution I could come up with, which was to treat each of the paths as unique keys in a shallow hash (while converting periods to underscores to follow a Ruby convention), something like this (using Ruby symbols, instead of strings for the keys):\n\nFrom there its just a matter of converting the hash to a Virtus object. Usually a Virtus attribute has a set type so that it knows what to coerce to, but in this case there are over 200 configurations in the default config and of course a config can contain arbitrary stuff from the user or another plugin, so there is no way to set this all up before hand. Luckily Virtus comes metaprogramming ready and it was easy enough to add attributes on the fly, I simply checked for booleans (including TW's idea of \"yes\"/\"no\" and \"on\"/\"off\"), floats, integers, and the finally just said everything else was a string and to just keep it like it is.\nMoving forward\nI plan to have a basic controller implementation in place by the end of next week or sometime during Spring Break. Once that's in place I'll be able to start splitting time between task_time and rtasklib again.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/rtasklib-update-march-16th/","title":"rtasklib update march 16th"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/rtasklib-update-ruby-and-external-tools/":{"body":"It turns out that one of the reasons Ruby was popular before the advent of Rails was because it was so easy to integrate with 3rd party tools through subprocesses. In fact Ruby has at least 7 ways of executing processes either in the core or the standard libraries and many more user implemented varieties. Since rtasklib is at its core concerned with interacting with a subprocess having a solid understanding of the available options is important. Below I summarize the results of my research for several of Ruby's subprocess methods.\nKernel#exec, exec('echo exec')\nExec works by actually changing the current process into whatever its parameter is. So anything that comes after an exec call in a Ruby program will never execute. This is useful for tasks where that call is the last action the program takes as well as acting as the basic building block off of which all the other commands are implemented.\nKernel#`,  `echo backticks` =&gt; exit code\nThe one I often used before researching this was the 'backtick' methd, where every statement between backticks is passed to a subprocess (using Kernel#fork and Kernel#exec under the hood) and returns the exit code. This looks like a special statement in Ruby, but really its just a little syntactic sugar around a kernel method. Obviously, for rtasklib I'm interested in the actual output of the process, not just whether it was successful, so another technique is needed.\nKernel#system, system('echo system') =&gt; STDOUT\nA slightly different kernel method is system, which works the same under the hood as the backticks method, but instead of returning the exit code it returns STDOUT. This is more useful, but both are necessary for my purposes.\nOpen3#popen3\nOpen3 is a module included in the standard libraries that offers a little bit more control over the process along with a Ruby-style block DSL. It has a number of methods available for various levels of control and piping processes together. The closest to what I want is Open3#popen3, which offers the most control. A simple used case would look like the following:\n\nThis is closer to what I want, but managing interactive sessions (which does happen occasionally with task) starts to get messy, is their a better way?\nPTY and ruby_expect\nEnter the standard library PTY and the external gem ruby_expect both of these work similarly to Open3, but allow you to work with interactive sessions cleanly by implementing an interface similar to the UNIX tool Expect. The syntax of the two are slightly different, but the basic idea is that you create a subprocess and provide a way to respond to a given regex. An example of ruby_expects syntax is shown below.\n\nConclusion\nRight now I'm using the ruby_expect gem, but I've also implemented the PTY version as well and have been switching back and forth between the two. They both do what I want, but lack good documentation. The benefit of using the pure Ruby gem is that it is much easier to read than the C implementation, though I haven't checked out the Rubinius version (the Ruby interpreter written in Ruby), which might have a Ruby version of PTY.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/rtasklib-update-ruby-and-external-tools/","title":"rtasklib update = Ruby and external tools"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/rtasklib-update/":{"body":"In the Ruby world the most common way to generate documentation is with Yardocs. It basically generates documentation by scraping the code comments and provides a structured API for writing comments that it can interpret.

In general I'm not a huge fan of IDEs anyways, but the Processing one is especially terrible. It's obviously been designed to abstract away programming concepts to make the barrier to entry really low (I think it was originally made to help artist make procedural art), but in the end this makes for an annoying experience for those of us with a bit of experience.\n\nOn top of this over the last year or so I have become attached to Vim as my go to editor. So when I start writing in the Processing IDE my code ends up littered with wwwweajjl or :w and the like. So when I found out that there was a command line program to run a sketch I jumped at the opportunity to add it into my Vim workflow.\nSupposedly if you are running the Windows or Linux versions of Processing the command line bit comes pre-installed, but I haven't had a chance to test that out for myself yet so you may need to experiment with that.

For my Natural Language Processing class we recently approached the problem of Word Sense Disambiguation from a Machine Learning perspective (we also looked at others, including lookup approaches like Lesk), using the simple, but effective, decision list algorithm. This is my attempt at visualizing the results.\n\nThe WSD task is determining which ambiguous meaning of a word is intended, usually based on the context, e.g. play bass guitar versus caught a largemouth bass.\nIn order to accomplish this we look at the words surrounding the text looking for hints like part of speech (which can be derived from a pre-trained tagger) and words, so for example a rule could be +1 word is guitar or -2 word is a common noun (NN), where +/- k is relative to the ambiguous word in question.\nFrom here we go through the entire training corpus creating a conditional probability distribution of all possible rules with the appropriate sense marked (using the notation word and word* for the two senses). With the distribution of rules we can than easily rank their effectiveness using the log likelihood formula given below:\n\n\n  $$\n    \\left|{\\log_2{\\frac{Pr(word \\mid rule)}{Pr(word* \\mid rule)}}}\\right|\n  $$\n\n\nThe idea here is that rules that are equally common across the senses don't give us any real information so they'll get low likelihoods (e.g. determiners like the), whereas ones that occur frequently with just one sense get high likelihoods (e.g. specific content words like guitar).\nGiven this list of rules with their relative ranks we can sort them by log likelihood. This is why we took the absolute value before, because rules weighted towards sense* will be negative and we want to sort by magnitude. Using the algorithm is as simple as running a sample sentence through the list of rules accepting the first one to find a match.\n\nUsually the results of the algorithm on an untouched test corpus are reported as a confusion matrix or histogram, along with some raw stats like error reduction over baseline or F-scores. While these are useful to understanding the performance of the algorithm, it does little to help you understand why it performs that way. Only the histogram gives you any idea about the data distribution and that's the only thing it does.\nThat's where my Sankey diagram comes in, traditionally these sort of diagrams are used to show how some distribution changes over time or distance. While in this case time is not particularly meaningful (the algorithm can train/test thousands of examples in a couple of seconds), there is a linear, step-by-step process at work and that's where a flow diagram can be useful.\nWhat I decided on for the final version was a three step process: rule distribution per word sense, likelihood distribution per rule (binned to integers), and finally accuracy distribution per likelihood. Here are the two final diagrams:\n\n\n\n\nNote: you can hover over the links to see the exact numbers and you can drag the nodes around to get a better view of the various connections\n\nThe most obvious observation from this visualization is just how many low likelihoods there are in both cases (incidentally this is because the likelihoods of rules with just 1 example end up 3 for the bass case and 4 for the sake case), but also how few times they actually get applied.\nOne major assumption in this algorithm is that higher likelihood will have better results, how good is this assumption? We can't tell that from the confusion matrix, but with the Sankey diagram every incorrect answer can be traced back to the rule's likelihood that made a mistake. Here we can see that no rule with a likelihood greater than 5 ever makes a mistake in both cases, which shows that the assumption is not only pretty good, but also consistent across use cases.\n&lt;%= image_tag image_path(\"first-attempt.svg\"), alt: \"Reign-Gold tree as a first attempt\", style: \"width: 66%; float: right\" %&gt;\nAnother takeaway is how few rules we have for the sake* case and also how low in the decision list those that exist are. This shows an non-obvious limitation of the algorithm, it needs similar distributions of data. Even though this algorithm performed \"better\" in overall accuracy then the bass case, it still only got 50% of the sake as in wine cases correct.\nMy first attempt (incomplete version shown to the right) was the straight forward Reign-Gold tree diagram with labelled nodes. This admittedly shows the exact numbers immediately (without hover over), but it loses the high level visual cues of size and is not interpreted necessarily as a temporal flow like the Sankey approach.\n\n\n\n\n&lt;%= javascript_include_tag 'sankey' %&gt;\n&lt;%= javascript_include_tag 'sankey_has_many' %&gt;\n\n\n\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/sankey-diagram-of-rule-distributions-for-word-sense-disambiguation/","title":"Sankey diagram of rule distributions for word sense disambiguation"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/setting-up-a-nice-unix-ruby-dev-env/":{"body":"Setting up a Ruby environment is deceptively simple. Easy to do, hard to maintain. The two major players, RVM and rbenv, offer more than the typical user needs or can possibly understand. Here I walk you through my setup using tools that do one thing and do it well. Coincidently all these tools that I use were written by the same guy/girl who goes by the handle Postmodern.\n\nSo what are our goals coming out of this setup?\n\n\nA way to easily install new versions of Ruby without conflicting with and system versions or each other.\n\n\nA way to easily switch between versions on a per project basis, preferably automatically so we can set it and forget it.\n\n\n(Optional) A way to manage where Gems (libraries) are being installed to eliminate any weird conflicts that may occur again on a per project basis.\n\n\nLuckily, Postmodern has written a single app for each of these tasks.\n\n\nruby-install\n\n\nchruby (a.k.a. change-ruby)\n\n\ngem_home (formerly chgems)\n\n\nThe great thing about this division of concerns is that even if you don't like how one part of the system works you can always swap it out for another. For instance, if you like chruby, but want to still install a bleeding edge ruby versions (not supported by design w/ruby-install) and want to use something else like RVM (or MRVM, M for mini), that will just work no questions asked.\nLet's get started!\nInstall new versions of ruby with ruby-install\nRuby-install comes with great package manger support, and of course you could just install it with wget or curl as well. Their github page covers installation pretty well, so I'll just leave that and say that I used the brew version without incident:\n\nTo view available rubies to install automatically just run it without arguments\n\nYou can then install them with varying levels of specificity. For example to install the stable version just run ruby-install rbx replacing rbx with whatever flavor of ruby you're interested in. Or if you want the latest major version of 1, just run ruby-install ruby-1, or ruby-install ruby-2.0 for the latest non 2.1 version. You get the idea, it's pretty intelligent at figuring out what you want to do.\nWant to install a ruby not listed yet, or no longer supported by default? No problem just pass the MD5 of the latest release or a path to a ruby-lang.org download, ruby-install --md5 MD5_OF_TAR_BZ2 ruby 2.3.4 or $ ruby-install -M https://ftp.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby ruby 2.0.0-p247 respectively.\nYou can also change where it installs and who it installs under (e.g. root or you).\nManage active version of ruby with chruby\nSo we've installed a bunch of flavors of ruby to play with, but if you run which ruby in all likelihood something like /usr/bin/ruby will still show up. So how do we actually use these? We could manage the $PATH ourselves, but that is an annoying, error prone, and is the opposite of automatic.\nThat's where chruby comes in, installation and usage mirrors ruby-install nicely. So we can run chruby to get a list of rubies to use and marking the current one with an *, and select them in the same way that we did to install them (e.g. chruby rbx, chruby ruby-1, etc.). To go back to the system ruby just run chruby stable.\nTo automatically switch on a per-project basis all we need to do is make a file named .ruby-version with the contents of whatever we would pass chruby:\n\n(Optional) Manage the gem path with gem_home\nWhile chruby manages your $GEM_PATH on a per ruby basis, sometimes you want a more sandboxed environment, like when you need to incompatible versions of the same gem for different projects. That's the purpose gem_home serves.\nIt doesn't have quite as good of package manager support, but is still easy enough to install, just follow the instructions on github.\nThe typical use case for me would be to change into the project's directory and then run:\n\nThis will install your Gems to $PWD/.gem/ unless they are already installed, in which case it will just use those.\nThat's it!

This is a little bit of a paradigm shift for me personally, as for most of my projects distribution means pushing to a Heroku instance, so I've had to brain storm some new non-web-based projects. I've come up with two basic trains of thought either a better time-tracking/Freshbooks integration for taskwarrior (the current ones are all bare-bones) or any number of music/analytics ideas for the music players, specifically MPD.\n\nFor now I've decided to just review MPD, its current state, and what options are available to me in terms of wrappers (preferably Ruby wrappers, my scripting language of choice). The goal here is to just establish what the MPD landscape looks like so that I can effectively scope an 11-12 week project.\nThe Music Player Daemon\nFirst off it's important to establish what MPD is and isn't. It is a music player that works with a server-client architecture. It plays music, organizes playlists, and maintains a database of music. What it isn't is a client to play with, you need anyone of many clients to do this from ncurses-command line based players to GUI players that resemble iTunes. In this way it does one thing well and very efficiently, which is why I've decided to target it as the home for any music-based apps I want to create.\nSo where to start? There is extensive documentation of the C++ inner workings of MPD here. One important part of any integration with other music programs is playlist formats, MPD supports embcue, m3u, extm3u, pls, and xspf through a plugin system. It uses m3u by default, which is an extremely simple format consisting of only the time in seconds, the artist, the name, and the file path.\n\nThis is nice from a readability standpoint, but there is problem, it hard codes all the file paths, which makes it hard to port from one platform to another. That's one thing that .xspf tries to remedy., it uses a unique identifier (mbid from MusicBrainz for example) to resolve different file locations to the same unique identifier, here's a basic example file:\n\nSo what libraries are already out there to further investigate?\nRuby Libraries\nSpfy - a Ruby Xspf parser (last commit 03/2014)\nXspf - a Ruby Xspf parser (last commit 04/2007), source code forge is down, so this one is fairly rusty.\nSince the .xspf spec is simple, well formed XML, is using one of these Ruby wrappers necessary?

I realized that I was reinventing the wheel a bit with the domain objects and to some extent with the data type coercions (though obviously some custom coercions will be necessary).\n\nI want to implement a familiar interface for developers to interact with the TW database, like the guys behind the Python taskllb tried to do with Django's QuerySet. So I looked into writing it as a simple adapter for one of the major Ruby ORMs, ActiveRecord, DataMapper, and ROM (Ruby Object Mapper). The ActiveRecord implementation is not particularly friendly to non-SQL data stores and has been quite a bit of work for people using NoSQL to write adapters for. Datamapper had several plain text adapters written (YAML, CSV, etc.), but the whole project had been pretty much been abandoned for ROM. I spent the most time messing around with ROM, it really is a new paradigm for an ORM (the developers might argue it isn't actually an ORM), but it has not yet hit its 1.0 release and the API keeps changing. So even though they had several plaintext data store adapters implemented, they no longer worked with the current release. And while I think I could probably get it working with a little work, I realized I was spending too much time on it for the value it would bring to this particular project.\nHowever, the time spent with ROM was not a complete loss, because the people working on it have also released part of its core as a separate gem, Virtus, specifically for working with domain objects and providing a framework for coercing data types (as well as handling finalization and circular dependencies).\nFor the validation layer I'm test driving the Veto gem, I was considering using ActiveModel and just including the validations submodule, but if Veto can do the trick that would remove a fairly heavy dependency.\nFor reading in the config I was thinking about just using just a simple Hash data structure, which is what the Python wrapper taskw did. One downfall of this approach is that TW doesn't configs don't actually work like that internally, so we end up with situations like this:\n\nWhich cannot be stored as a hash, taskw admits this and prefers child configs to parent ones. That's why I'm going to treat the .taskrc file as its own read-only domain object, perhaps generated by the task show command or by reading the ~/.taskrc with something like parseconfig, though since TW uses dot syntax it might be just as simple to implement it myself (something like this quick and dirty gist).\nBig Picture\nHere's a broad sweeping overview of my currently planned architecture. The following shows the modules, classes, as well as inheritance and composition and some of the class methods. Of course all this is subject to change, but this is where I am at right now.\n\nMoving Forward\nI hope to have the models 'done' by next week and hopefully enough of the architecture around it done so that I can begin building task_time against it as quickly as possible, so I can figure out the design flaws earlier rather than later.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/task-time-and-rtasklib-updates-march-8th/","title":"task_time and rtasklib updates March 8th"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/task-time-update-march-1st/":{"body":"Last week I talked about picking an appropriate TaskWarrior wrapper for my task_time project. A rundown of the options are taskw (Python, GPL, low on documentation, durations not implemented yet), tasklib (Python, BSD, good documentation, durations not implemented, does not read in users .taskrc), and taskwarrior (Ruby, MIT, just does JSON marshalling/unmarshalling). In the end I decided none of these were actually going to cut it, since none implemented duration features, so my choices were to either Fork and implement durations and whatever other features were needed or to roll my own. In the end I really would rather use Ruby for this so I decided that it would be good to write the wrapper from scratch, while taking cues from each of the other implementations. I named the repo rtasklib in following with the ruby convention of naming wrappers with lib and either a leading r or trailing _ruby (dashes imply a subclass and are only used when your're gem extends an existing gem not an external program). You can find the repo at dropofwill/rtasklib and the task_time repo at dropofwill/task_time.\n\nSo far I've been working on the data conversion process and setting up a sandboxed testing environment (I don't want to run these tests on my local database of tasks after all :) ). Luckily with TaskWarrior you can just point it to a separate .taskrc and it will create a database wherever its told, so I have it setting one up inside my spec's data directory. I've setup Coveralls (for test coverage monitoring) and Travis-Ci (for continuous integration) on both projects (though task_time isn't being tested in a meaningful way at the moment). One problem I ran into was installing TaskWarrior on Travis Ubuntu machine, it turns out the Ubuntu repos are 4 minor versions behind, which is a lot of missing TaskWarrior functionality (including stuff that task_time will require to work), so I had to figure out how to install it from source, which took a few tries to get working right (see the .travis.yml). I don't know how Ubuntu users can stand that sort of turn around on repo updates, but that's another gripe for another time.\nAs far as data conversions go, the TaskWarrior data is subtlely more complicated than it seems. There are supposedly only 4 data types: string, numeric, date, and duration. In Ruby numerics should be represented as Fixnum (ints), Floats, or Bigdecimal/Bignum if need be. It also turns out that the string data type in the TaskWarrior world can also mean array of strings and these are used interchangeably internally. Dates and Durations can be represented with varying levels of precision, precise versions are represented in the standard ISO8601 format, no matter how the user inputs it (though they add their own idea of negative durations to the spec for things that are past due...). But there are also named dates like mon or eoww (end of work week), as well as the interesting someday and later that represent January 18th, 2038. Luckily the source code is available so I should be able to figure this out (as you can tell by the badge on the repo, I'm not there yet). From what I can tell the other repos just choke on the named dates, so there's not a lot of help to be had there. My current approach is to extend (internally, Ruby lets you modify everything at runtime) the ISO8601 ruby gem to support these weird formats as well.\nFeatures I like from other implementations\ntaskw\n\nReads in the users .taskrc to make sure it handles data manipulation correctly. Tasklib implements a config object, but does not create this from the user's config.\n\ntasklib\n\n\nMakes the API follow Django's QuerySet, I'm going to try to do the same with Ruby's ActiveRecord. Following an existing API makes the onboarding process for new developers easier and makes sense for this project since TW is really just a plain text DB.\n\n\nKind of a minor thing, but messing around with it I think it validates user input way too late in the process, if a process is going to fail it should do so as early as possible, not just the moment before it saves to the db.\n\n\nAll the code is thrown into a single file, which is kind of ridiculous.\n\n\ntaskwarrior\n\n\nUses ActiveModel to handle validating user input, which makes the implementation super clean. No need to reinvent the wheel here.\n\n\nHas an examples section along with his Gantt chart plugin, which I think is crucial. Obviously, I'm going to have task_time as one major example, but I think it's important to design the wrapper against a few different use cases so that they don't end up getting too tightly coupled.\n\n\nMoving Forward\nMy goal is to get rtasklib to a point where I can start working on task_time in 2 weeks, that doesn't mean stable or feature complete or anything like that, just that it has implemented basic import/export functionality (so Open3 cmdline implementation, data-type conversions, and basic filtering). Once I get to that point I should be able to continue to develop them in parallel. In the meantime I've started to hash out the public interfaces for task_time, for now I've put it on the README.md, but I'm probably going to move it to PLAN.md in the near future.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/task-time-update-march-1st/","title":"task_time update March 1st"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/taskwarrior-timesheet-plugin-plan/":{"body":"This is a plan for a project that will act as a plugin for the application Taskwarrior that allows the users to use task to keep track of their time involved with tasks. I chose task_time as the name because the original program is run with the task command and in Ruby underscores are used to denote spaces (dashes imply some sort of class hierarchy).\n\nRepo: dropofwill/task_time\nAbstract\nTaskwarrior is a lightweight command-line applications that makes managing/filtering/reporting/understanding of your todos easier. One aspect that it is missing is time-tracking the developers say that this feature is out of scope and should be remedied with a plugin, the currently available plugins don't mirror Taskwarrior's attention to detail or polish and seem to be fairly minimal (no offense to those maintainers).\nDetailed Description\nThe interface for this project will be that of a simple command line tool, at some point I want to write or extend a current ncurses layout to use this as well, but that is out of scope for this phase of the project. I'm thinking that the entry point will be task_time &lt;filter&gt; with an optional shell script for users that want a more seamless integration that will take task &lt;filter&gt; time just like you would use it if it was built into Taskwarrior itself. All the task filtering will be passed on to task behind the scenes, so I won't have to reimplement that.\nThe user will probably be something like start and stop for keeping track of the raw data, est for estimating how long a task is going to take, and then some other commands for generating the reports based on the previous time spent (filtering by project, task, tag, whatever). Another feature I would like to implement is a Kanban workflow. For all the reports I want to be able to export them to the command line to view and export to a number of formats (json, csv, xml, etc) like for all the other Taskwarrior reports, but also a PDF export from any Tilt-based template.\nExcitement (or why do you care about a todo app)\nTaskwarrior is an tool I use everyday, but as is I have to use another app (Freshbooks, Teamwork, etc.) to track my time spent on tasks for work and I end up not tracking my time for anything else. An important part of being a productive developer is understanding the end-to-end process: how long should this take? How long did it take? And why? Having actual data and reporting about this should make this process easier to understand.\nPlus all I write these days are web apps, yet most of what I use day-to-day is in the terminal, it will be nice to work on something where I'm the target audience for once. :)\nScope\nNothing is ever finished, but I think the scope of this project is such that I can make an initial release by the end of the class (see Milestones). As this is something I plan on using a lot, I imagine I will continue working on it after class is over.\nLicense\nMy license of choice is the Creative Commons 0, because I prefer to be as permissive as possible (and I don't care about attribution). But since that is not OSI approved (and it needs to be for this class), my backup is the MIT, which is fairly permissive and the default license for Ruby projects and the license that Taskwarrior is released under, so it probably makes the most sense anyways.\nMilestones\n\n\nInitial functionality: internals work and public API finalized. Rough due date = March 16th, may shift back if I need to spend more time on implementing functionality in the wrapper.\n\n\nReporting and external integration: all the charts and reporting features are working and any integration with external services are finalized. Rough due date = April 27th\n\n\nInitial Release: full to near full test coverage and packaged and submitted to at a minimum: RubyGems, AUR, and Debian (possibly also RPM as time permits). Rough due date = May 14th\n\n\nProgramming languages\nThis shouldn't be a resource heavy project, all the heavy lifting will be done by taskwarrior itself (written in C++), for that reason I want to use Ruby, which is my interpreted language goto. If speed becomes an issue pivoting to Rust or C is always an option, but I do not foresee that as a problem.\nThat said right now the Ruby library for interacting with Taskwarrior is a little out of date (missing a couple major Taskwarrior updates), so I'm going to have to either fork that project to add the functionality I need or pivot and write the project in Python, which has a more actively developed wrapper that seems to be up to date. I'll have to make that decision pretty soon, I'm reviewing my options now.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/taskwarrior-timesheet-plugin-plan/","title":"Taskwarrior timesheet plugin plan"},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/word-sense-disambiguation-with-python/":{"body":"One of the first things you realize when working with any sort of linguistic data is just how ambiguous just about anything we say or write really is. From the smallest units of sound (what was that garbled bit of sound?) to the document unit of meaning (what was that article about?), there aren't many parts of language that we can be 100% sure of even as native speakers, much less as an outside observer, like our programs.\n\nNevertheless, we have solved a number of very difficult problems to a reasonable degree of accuracy with computational approaches. Today I'm going to talk about one of the more naive approaches to word sense disambiguation, which actually does fairly well when given a reasonably large input.\nBut first, what's this Word Sense Disambiguation all about. Well, a words sense can is a way of identifying how we use a given word by associating it with a gloss, which you can think of as it's definition. For example the sense in which I'm using the word sense according to WordNet (a corpus that keeps track of all this) is sense.n.02. That means the root word is sense, it's being used as a noun, and it is the second most common usage of the word. The gloss associated with this sense is:\n\nthe meaning of a word or expression; the way in which a word or expression or situation can be interpreted\n\nOther root words and part of speech are possible, for example another senses of this word is common_sense.n.01 or smell.v.05. This is where the ambiguity problem comes in how does a computer know how to treat a given input when each one has a number of different senses, some of which have wildly different connotations and usages? This one problem is a key building block for all sorts of more complex, interesting NLP systems, from sentiment analysis to machine translation.\nOne simple approach to this problem is to use a tool like WordNet to lookup the various senses and compare their glosses and examples to the context that the word was found in. This technique is called the Simplified Lesk algorithm (simplified because he started out with a more complex probabilistic approach, but found that on smaller datasets this naive approach actually performs better!).\nFirst things first import the magic that is going to help us on our task:\n\nNext the main function, we'll save our results as we go in a dict called res/results. This outlines the 3 major steps in the algorithm:\n\nNormalize the word into its root form\nQuery WordNet or some other resource to get the set of possible senses\nLoop over these sense computing the overlap between their glosses and examples and our context.\n\n\nTo get the normalized form we use NLTK's excellent built in tool, Morphy, which uses a sequence of rules to transform (or transduce) it to a root word. Next we use that base form to query WordNet for all possible senses.\n\nNow onto the fun part: the Simplified Lesk. First we initialize the tokenizer we imported earlier with a regular expression that basically says to break up a given string into an array of consecutive (+) alphabetic characters (\\w).\n\nNext we initalize the best_sense variable to equal the first WordNet sense, that way if we don't get any hits we can default back to the most common sense. Same with overlap, we haven't compared anything yet so how would we know how much any given context overlaps?\n\nStopwords are usually function words (is, the, me, etc.) that hold a great deal of syntactic meaning, but aren't that helpful in semantic analysis. NLTK comes with a default set for English that has pretty good coverage, we then extend the list to include the words we're dealing with since that might influence the results unintentionally.\n\nNext we use the tokenizer and the list of stop words to generate a set of content tokens from the context using the python concept of list comprehensions.\n\nFinally we loop over sense, grab its definition and any examples and tokenize that in the same way as with the context. We then compute the overlap between the two sets and keep track of which tallies up the most overlap as we go. Once it's all done we return the sense with the most results.\n\nBut what about the compute_overlap bit, I hear you saying. Well that's simple, since we're dealing with sets that's as simple as taking the length (len()) of the intersection (&amp;) between them.\n\nAnd that's it, while this might seem way to simple it actually works fairly well because there usually aren't a lot of senses and the distribution is heavily weighted towards the top (so our default state is right a large percentage of the time). If you want to see a complete working example (that also computes some other features like word similarity) check out the full script.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/word-sense-disambiguation-with-python/","title":"Word Sense Disambiguation with Python"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/":{"body":0,"title":0},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/a-comparison-of-task-warrior-wrappers/":{"body":278,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/a-scanner-orderly-the-smart-coaster/":{"body":498,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/blink-project-hacking-on-an-arduino/":{"body":405,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/bugfix-footable/":{"body":537,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/c-graph-a-new-tool-to-grok-c-source-code/":{"body":473,"title":8},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/commnad-line-tools-with-ruby/":{"body":435,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/creating-and-deploying-a-middleman-blog-part-1-what-s-middleman/":{"body":601,"title":8},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/creating-and-deploying-a-middleman-blog-part-2-blogging-with-middleman/":{"body":279,"title":8},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/creating-and-deploying-a-middleman-blog-part-3-deployment/":{"body":439,"title":7},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/geocoding-my-lastfm-data/":{"body":747,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/mouse-rat-rethinking-the-mouse-computer-interface/":{"body":165,"title":6},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/mouse-rat-technical-explanation/":{"body":399,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/my-vim-config-part-1-the-basics/":{"body":380,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/my-vim-config-part-2-shortcut-keys/":{"body":411,"title":6},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/packaging-ruby-gems/":{"body":140,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/playing-power-chords-on-an-arduino/":{"body":238,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/rtasklib-first-release/":{"body":140,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/rtasklib-update-march-16th/":{"body":208,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/rtasklib-update-ruby-and-external-tools/":{"body":293,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/rtasklib-update/":{"body":85,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/run-processing-sketches-from-vim/":{"body":221,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/sankey-diagram-of-rule-distributions-for-word-sense-disambiguation/":{"body":449,"title":7},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/setting-up-a-nice-unix-ruby-dev-env/":{"body":403,"title":7},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/source-code-review-of-mpd-and-mpd-wrappers/":{"body":332,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/task-time-and-rtasklib-updates-march-8th/":{"body":299,"title":5},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/task-time-update-march-1st/":{"body":484,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/taskwarrior-timesheet-plugin-plan/":{"body":420,"title":4},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/word-sense-disambiguation-with-python/":{"body":439,"title":4}},"length":30},"lang":"English"}
