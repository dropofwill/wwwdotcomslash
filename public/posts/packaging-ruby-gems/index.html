  <h1>Packaging Ruby gems</h1>
  <time>May 10, 2015</time>
  <div class="large-10 large-offset-1 columns typeset">
    <p>In the Ruby community the most common way to distribute software is in a packaged format cutely named gems (similar to the Python concept of Eggs). This manages dependencies and meta data much like the other packaging platforms, but with Ruby syntax in a file called '#{you_gems_name}.gemspec'. This process is completely automated through the Ruby gems, <code>gem</code> (installation/RubyGems.org integration), <code>bundler</code> (dependency management and boiler plate code), and <code>rake</code> (Ruby make, to streamline the process).</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span>
<p>So the release process is as simple as updating the metadata (version number, and any changelog, or whatever) and running <code>rake build</code>, <code>rake release</code>. From there anyone with a working Ruby install and internet connection can simply run <code>gem install #{your_gem_name}</code>. They could also take the local gem created by <code>rake build</code> and <code>gem install #{path/to/gem}</code>.</p>
<p>This makes sense for my <code>rtasklib</code> library, because it is really only useful for people who are already using Ruby and are familiar with its conventions. But what about for <code>task_time</code>? In an ideal world users wouldn't even have to know that it runs on Ruby. Luckily Fedora has <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:Ruby?rd=Packaging/Ruby">an extensive guide</a> for packaging gems into RPMs. It makes the distinction between gems used as libraries (like <code>rtasklib</code>), gems used as applications (like <code>task_time</code>), Ruby scripts not in the gem format. The plan is to release both libraries on <a href="https://rubygems.org/profiles/dropofwill">RubyGems.org/profiles/dropofwill</a> so that they will be internet accessible, as well as a library RPM package for <code>rtasklib</code> and an application RPM package for <code>task_time</code>.</p>
