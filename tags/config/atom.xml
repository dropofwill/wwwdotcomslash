        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Setting up a Ruby environment is deceptively simple. Easy to do, hard to maintain. The two major players, RVM and rbenv, offer more than the typical user needs or can possibly understand. Here I walk you through my setup using tools that do one thing and do it well. Coincidently all these tools that I use were written by the same guy&#x2F;girl who goes by the handle Postmodern.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is a continuation of my short series (&lt;a href=&quot;&#x2F;2014&#x2F;11&#x2F;02&#x2F;my-vim-config-part-1-the-basics&#x2F;&quot;&gt;part 1&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;) on how I setup Vim to be a little more fully featured looking at the custom shortcuts. By no means is my setup the best, but there are a few neat things I&#x27;ve stumbled upon and my thought is that by aggregating them here someone else might find something new to add. Or maybe someone knows a better way to do something and lets me know. So let&#x27;s get started!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;As someone that came to Vim from Sublime Text (through the excellent Vi-ntage mode), one thing that held me back was just how annoying the default Vim settings are. In a way looking back at it that wasn&#x27;t a bad thing, it let me really craft my own configuration that I&#x27;m pretty happy with, but always looking for ways to improve. In order to help someone else a who is headed down that path find a config that works for them a little quicker.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
